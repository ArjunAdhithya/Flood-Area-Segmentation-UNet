# Flood Area Segmentation Using U-Net
This project involves 
flood area segmentation using a U-Net model. The goal of the project is 
to train a model to predict flood areas from images using a U-Net 
architecture. The dataset contains flood images, corresponding masks for
 the flood areas, and a CSV file that links images with their masks.
Project Structure
The project contains the following components:
Image Dataset: The input images used for training and validation.
Mask Dataset: The corresponding segmentation masks indicating flood areas.
CSV File: A CSV file linking the images to their respective masks.
Jupyter Notebook: Contains the full workflow for loading the data, training the U-Net model, validating it, and visualizing the predictions.

Model Architecture
The model used in
 this project is a U-Net, a popular architecture for image segmentation 
tasks. U-Net is composed of an encoder-decoder architecture with skip 
connections to preserve spatial features. The model is trained to 
predict the flood areas in the given images.
Requirements
To run this project, you'll need the following libraries:
Python 3.x
TensorFlow
Keras
NumPy
Matplotlib
Pandas
